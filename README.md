# Todo List Application

This is a simple command-line Todo List application implemented in Python. It allows users to create tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as completed, and manage their todo list effectively.

## Features

The Todo List application provides the following features:

- **Add Task**: Users can add a new task to their todo list by providing a title, description, and due date for the task.

- **View All Tasks**: Users can view all the tasks in their todo list. The list displays the title, description, due date, and completion status of each task.

- **View Incomplete Tasks**: Users can view only the incomplete tasks from their todo list. This allows users to focus on the tasks that still need to be completed.

- **View Completed Tasks**: Users can view only the completed tasks from their todo list. This provides a way to see the tasks that have already been finished.

- **Mark Task as Completed**: Users can mark a specific task as completed by providing the index of the task in the list. Once marked as completed, the task's completion status is updated.

- **Exit**: Users can exit the application when they are done managing their todo list.
